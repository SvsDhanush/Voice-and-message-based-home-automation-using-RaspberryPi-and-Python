# Voice-and-message-based-home-automation-using-RaspberryPi-and-Python
A voice based home automation system from scratch using raspberry pi and some of the sensors. I have coded our program in python which helps to understand the voice commands given by the user and perform the respective actions and also the user receives some important messages through telegram bot which we have created. We will use different APIâ€™s available in python to get various real time information like Google Cloud Speech API to convert the voice command into text, weather API to get real time temperature and weather and also some other libraries to get the present time and day.
So, in this project, we are going to build a Alexa kind of Raspberry-Pi based Voice Assistance that can listen, respond, and control a few things. We have directly performed Speech Recognition on Raspberry Pi, so we can directly connect a microphone to our Pi and speak into it and in this report we will be talking about how we will be implementing our project and the areas where we can improve our implementations.
